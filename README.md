# Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset Interactive Dashboard

## Background
This project is focused on building an interactive dashboard exploring the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset. This dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. It reveals that a small handful of microbial species(also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
